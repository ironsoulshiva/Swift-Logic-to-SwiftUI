# Swift Logic → SwiftUI Practice Repository 🚀

This repository is created to help beginners and intermediate iOS developers
practice 
**Swift programming logic** and then **convert that logic into SwiftUI mini apps**.

The goal is simple:
> Think logically → Code in Swift → Visualize using SwiftUI

---

## 📌 What This Repo Contains

- ✅ Swift logic problems (conditionals, loops, functions)
- ✅ Same problems converted into SwiftUI apps
- ✅ Real-world examples, not textbook theory
- ✅ Clean, beginner-friendly code
- ✅ Daily progress tracking

---

## 🧠 Who Is This For?

- Students learning Swift from scratch
- Developers transitioning from Swift → SwiftUI
- Anyone preparing for iOS interviews
- Self-learners doing a 30/60/90-day challenge

## 📂 Folder Structure Explained

| Folder | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| `01_Swift_Basics` | Simple Swift problems (if-else, loops) |
| `02_Swift_Logic` | Slightly complex logic problems |
| `03_SwiftUI_Basics` | Basic SwiftUI apps |
| `04_SwiftUI_Logic_Apps` | Full logic-driven mini apps |
| `Progress_Log.md` | Daily learning & reflection log |

## 🧪 How to Use This Repo

### Step 1
Open a Swift file and try solving the problem **without UI**

### Step 2
Understand the logic and refactor if needed

### Step 3
Rebuild the same logic using **SwiftUI**
- `@State`
- Conditional rendering
- Loops with `ForEach`

### Step 4
Write a short README inside each app folder explaining:
- Problem
- Logic
- SwiftUI concepts used

---

## ⏱ Daily Practice Rule (Recommended)

- Solve **at least 1 problem/day**
- More problems = bonus
- Push code daily (even small progress)

Consistency > perfection.

## 🙌 Final Note

Learning SwiftUI is not about memorizing syntax.
It’s about **thinking clearly and expressing logic visually**.

Happy coding 💻🔥
